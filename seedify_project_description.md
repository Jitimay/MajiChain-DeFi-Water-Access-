# MajiChain - Project Description
**For Seedify Vibe Coins Submission**

## Project Description (150 words max)

MajiChain transforms cryptocurrency into clean water access for rural Africa through SMS-based payments. Using basic 2G networks, villagers send simple SMS messages like "PAY 5000 BIF PUMP001" to purchase water credits. Our AI bridge processes payments, validates transactions on Moonbase Alpha blockchain, and activates IoT water pumps dispensing clean water for exactly 4 seconds.

The system eliminates corruption through transparent blockchain transactions while working with existing mobile infrastructure. Built entirely with AI-assisted development using Claude and Cursor, MajiChain addresses UN SDG #6 (Clean Water) for 600+ million Africans lacking water access.

Revenue streams include transaction fees (2-5%) and B2B partnerships with NGOs, governments, and water utilities. The platform scales from single village kiosks to nationwide water networks, providing automated, corruption-free distribution that converts DeFi into drinkable water for communities that need it most.
